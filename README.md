#(ArcGIS.js <= 100) Responsive Edition
###Welcome to the ArcGIS JavaScript Code Challenge!

Everybody loves a cool mapping app, but everyone loves a cool, RESPONSIVE mapping app even more! This year's challenge is to write the best responsive mapping app with the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/index.html) in 100 lines or less. Prizes will be awarded for **1) the best overall app**, **2) best responsive app** (works on desktops, laptops, tablets & phones) and **3) best web-mobile app** (works on phone web browsers). The prizes include one-year subscriptions to [ArcGIS Online](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisonline) ($2500 each) and also a free 2015 Esri Dev Summit pass ($1000)!

To enter just make a pull request to submit your code (see [How to Enter](#how-to-enter) below).
We'll be announcing the winners live on stage at the [2014 Esri International Developer Summit](http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit/index.html), but **you don't need to attend the conference to win**.

Best of luck!

## Winners
Check back here on Thursday March 13th, 2014!

## Contest Period
- Starts: 9:00 AM PST Friday, Feb 1, 2014
- Closes: 6:00 PM PST Sunday Mar 9, 2014 (No entries will be accepted after this time.)

## How to Enter
1. Fork and then clone this repo.
2. Add a sub-folder with your app in it (see [example](basemaptour)).
3. Make a pull request on the **master** branch to submit your entry. This request represents your agreement to the [Terms and Conditions](Terms%20and%20Conditions%20Agreement.md).

NOTE: Be sure to Pull and Merge from this repo to get the latest before making your pull request!  We'll publish the app on gh-pages for you.

## Rules

1. Max 100 (sloc) lines of client-side JavaScript code. Max 100 chars per line. Not compressed.
2. Must use the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/index.html).
3. All ArcGIS JavaScript code must be in a single .js file (see Example below).
4. Each project must contain an index.html file (see Example below).
5. All project code (HTML, css, js...) must reside beneath a single root-level folder.
6. Application must be fully functional, portable, deployable and accessible from any public web-enabled directory.  
7. Applications must be freely distributable via Apache 2.0 license.
8. IMPORTANT: Libraries other than the ArcGIS API for JavaScript can be used and do not count toward the 100 line limit. Libraries referenced must be published and publicly available prior to February 1, 2014.  So that means you can't write libraries to hide your ArcGIS code!  You can use previously published ArcGIS libraries however.

See all rules, terms and conditions [here](Terms%20and%20Conditions%20Agreement.md).
